# hello-world
My first repository

I'm a bit confused on how this is going at this point.  I'm supposed to be in Learn.co but it appears that I'm in GitHub.  I'm hoping this comes together somehow.  About me, I'm currently out of work and looking to change careers as my field (Direct Marketing) is very niche and the opportunities are few.
